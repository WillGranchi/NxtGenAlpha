# Correct Railway Migration Command

The issue you encountered was that Railway couldn't find alembic. Here's the fix:

## Working Command

railway run --service web sh -c "cd /app && python -m alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head"

OR if Railway's working directory is different:

railway run --service web python -m alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head

## If migrations don't exist yet, create them first:

railway run --service web python -m alembic -c backend/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"

## Then run migrations:

railway run --service web python -m alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head

## Alternative: Use the script

railway run --service web bash scripts/run_migrations.sh
