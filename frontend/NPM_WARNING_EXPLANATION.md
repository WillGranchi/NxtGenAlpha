# npm Deprecation Warning Explanation

## Warning Message

```
npm warn config production Use `--omit=dev` instead.
```

## What This Means

This is a **deprecation warning** from npm, not an error. It appears during Railway's build process when Nixpacks runs `npm ci` with the `--production` flag.

## Impact

**✅ NO IMPACT ON DEPLOYMENT**

- The warning is cosmetic only
- Your application builds and deploys successfully
- All services run correctly
- This warning does not affect functionality

## Why It Appears

Railway's Nixpacks builder uses the deprecated `--production` flag internally when installing dependencies for production builds. This is Railway's build system behavior, which we cannot control directly.

## Solution

**Option 1: Ignore It (Recommended)**
- The warning is harmless
- Railway may update their build system in the future
- No action needed

**Option 2: Suppress (Limited Effect)**
- We've created `.npmrc` to attempt suppression
- Note: Railway's build process may still show the warning as it's generated by Railway's npm commands, not ours

## Verification

Your deployment is successful if you see:
- ✅ Backend logs show: "Application startup complete"
- ✅ Frontend logs show: "Accepting connections"
- ✅ Database logs show: "database system is ready to accept connections"

The npm warning can be safely ignored.
